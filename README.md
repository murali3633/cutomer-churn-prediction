# cutomer-churn-prediction
This customer churn prediction model uses a Random Forest classifier to identify potential churners based on customer data. The process involves data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, followed by training the model on a training set.
# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Overview
This project implements a customer churn prediction model using a Random Forest classifier. The model aims to identify customers at risk of leaving based on their attributes.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Random Forest classifier for prediction
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualization of feature importance

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- joblib

Model Evaluation
The model's performance will be displayed in the console, including accuracy and a classification report.

Feature Importance
Visualizations of feature importance will be generated to help understand which attributes contribute most to churn prediction.
